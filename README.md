Description of the project

The project here is a Kaggle competition dataset about the passengers who survived the titanic disaster.We have to predict here which passengeres survived and the passengers who died during the unfortunate incident.There are two datasets here: one is a train dataset on which we modelled various algorithms and the other one is the test dataset which doesnot contain the target column.

Here,i processed the data first,i.e.i decided how to prepare better features from the existing ones,then i selected the best features and finally i trained various models to find out which models gives the maximum aoc area and finally made a submission to Kaggle.
